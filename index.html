        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We believe AI should serve your domain with clarity and control. Our mission is to design intelligent systems that reason over your knowledge, documents, and data — turning information into action, and complexity into clarity. We ensure that your teams, tools, and users benefit from contextual intelligence without losing transparency, privacy, or ownership.</p>
        <p>From AI-powered search and retrieval to custom LLM tooling and semantic indexing, we design intelligent systems that help your team move faster, learn deeper, and scale smarter.</p>

        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>CortexOne is a scientific AI consultancy that helps companies extract, organize, and reason over structured and semi-structured knowledge. Our mission is to bring the full potential of domain-specific AI to your fingertips — responsibly, scalably, and precisely.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Codebase Reasoning:</strong> Extracting knowledge from source code, APIs, symbols, and internal docs using AST-based parsing and enriched LLM training.</li>
          <li><strong>Structured Knowledge Extraction:</strong> Turning spreadsheets, JSON, logs, or proprietary formats into clean, queryable representations for LLMs.</li>
          <li><strong>Fine-Tuned LLMs:</strong> Training domain-specific models that understand your company’s language, behavior, and architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Vector Search & Retrieval Augmentation:</strong> Structuring data for powerful in-context retrieval, enabling long-term memory, QA, and reasoning.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-Agent Systems:</strong> Designing AI agents that cooperate to retrieve, enrich, and compose answers or actions from complex inputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Hosted Architectures:</strong> Building privacy-preserving AI deployments fully under your control — no cloud lock-in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Our systems don’t just generate answers. They understand context, structure, and intent — tailored to your domain.</li>
          <li>Every tool we build is modular, explainable, and designed for maintainability.</li>
          <li>We prioritize auditability, security, and control in all deployments.</li>
          <li>We speak your language — whether it's Zig, Python, TypeScript, or domain-specific DSLs.</li>
          <li>We blend the best of academic research with pragmatic engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Work With You</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Strategy & architecture design</li>
          <li> Dataset creation, enrichment, and preparation</li>
          <li> Prompt engineering, retrieval tuning, and evaluation</li>
